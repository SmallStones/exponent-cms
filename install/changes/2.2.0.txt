version 2.2.0
The next major release and the first version of Exponent w/o any 1.0 modules, etc..., primarily will implement Container 2.0 and Twitter-Bootstrap
  * replaces the containermodule with container2 controller
  - forces deprecation/removal of formmodule/formbuilder, headlineController
    -- also fully deprecates/removes calendarmodule, simplepollmodule, & navigationmodule if they still exist
  - moves jQuery/Twitter-Bootstrap as primary libraries over YUI2/3 (which are still backwards compatible)
